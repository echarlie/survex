<Para>
Diffpos reports stations which
are in one file but not the other, and also stations which have moved
by more than a specified threshold distance in X, Y, or Z.  The
threshold distance is given in metres and defaults to 0.01m if not
specified.
</Para>

<Para>
For backward compatibility diffpos will also read the
<filename>.pos</filename> files produced by earlier versions of cavern, by
the (now removed) 3dtopos tool, by survexport, or by aven's export feature
(requires 1.2.19 or later).
