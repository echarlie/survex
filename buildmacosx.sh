# You'll need some development tools which aren't installed by default.  To
# get these you can install Xcode (which is a free download from Apple):
#
#   https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/
#
# To build, open a terminal (Terminal.app in the "Utils" folder in
# "Applications") and unpack the downloaded survex source code. E.g. for
# 1.2.17:
#
#   tar xf survex-1.2.17.tar.gz
#
# Then change directory into the unpacked sources:
#
#   cd survex-1.2.17
#
# And then run this script:
#
#   ./buildmacosx.sh
#
# This will automatically download and temporarily install wxWidgets,
# PROJ.4 and FFmpeg in subdirectories of the source tree (this script is smart
# enough not to re-download or re-build these if it already has).
#
# If you already have wxWidgets, PROJ.4 and/or FFmpeg installed permanently,
# you can disable these by passing one or more extra options - e.g. to build
# none of them, use:
#
#   ./buildmacosx.sh --no-install-wx --no-install-proj --no-install-ffmpeg
#
# If wxWidgets is installed somewhere such that wx-config isn't on your
# PATH you need to indicate where wx-config is by running this script
# something like this:
#
#   env WX_CONFIG=/path/to/wx-config ./buildmacosx.sh
#
# (If you set WX_CONFIG, there's no need to pass --no-install-wx).
#
# If using a pre-installed wxWidgets, note that it must satisfy the
# following requirements:
#
#   - It must be built with OpenGL support (--with-opengl).
#
# We strongly recommend using wxWidgets >= 3.0, but if you want to build with
# wxWidgets 2.8, it probably should be a "Unicode" build (--enable-unicode);
# wxWidgets >= 3.0 effectively is always a "Unicode" build, so the
# --enable-unicode option isn't needed (and is ignored if specified).
#
# This script builds diskimages which are known to work at least as far back
# as OS X 10.6.8.  A build of wxWidgets 3.0.2 with the options we pass will
# default to assuming at least OS X 10.5, but we've not heard from anyone
# trying with such an old version.
#
# Mac OS X support "fat" binaries which contain code for more than one
# processor, but the wxWidgets build system doesn't seem to allow creating
# these, so we have to choose what processor family to build for.  By default
# we build for the architecture of the version of OS X the build machine is
# running, which on a modern Mac will be x86_64, producing a build which will
# only work on 64-bit Intel Macs (but that's probably all machines modern
# enough to worry about).
#
# You can specify an arch explicitly on the command-line, e.g. to force a
# build for 64-bit Intel Macs:
#
#   ./buildmacosx.sh x86_64
#
# Or if you want a build which also works on older 32 bit Intel Macs, then run
# this script passing i386 on the command line, like so (assuming your compiler
# supports this):
#
#   ./buildmacosx.sh i386
#
# Or to build for much older machines with a Power PC processor, use (again
# assuming your compiler supports this):
#
#   ./buildmacosx.sh ppc
